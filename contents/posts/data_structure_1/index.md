### Goal: Use and design of data structures, which organize information in computer memory. Stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees: how to implement them in a high-level language, how to analyze their effect on algorithm efficiency, and how to modify them. Programming assignments.

## 1. Topics covered:
  * Java features: abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, generics, iterators, exception handling, file I/O
  * Recursion
  * Worst case asymptotic running time analysis
  * Abstract data types
  * Lists, stacks, queues
  * Trees (binary and binary search trees, AVL trees)
  * Sorting algorithms (merge sort, quicksort)
  * Hashing and hash tables
  * Priority Queues
